To find the origins of those fragments, the corresponding sequences are aligned to the genome; these alignments can then be used in downstream analyses. However, this alignment process is complicated by the fact that the genome has many highly similar and repetitive sequences, making it difficult or impossible to unambiguously assign some sequences to a single genomic location. To address this problem, we have developed SmartMap, which serves to process and appropriately weight the alignments of reads that map to more than one genomic location. This enables us to examine many genomic regions that were previously “invisible” to analysis and helps us draw new insights into the regulation and function of repetitive elements of the genome.","tags":null,"title":"Sequence deeper without sequencing more: Bayesian resolution of ambiguously mapped reads","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Richter","Rohan Shah","Alexander Ruthenburg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607040000,"objectID":"eaa37b2bec3de5d76f502e782abd599f","permalink":"https://shah-rohan.github.io/publication/richter-h3k79me2/","publishdate":"2020-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/richter-h3k79me2/","section":"publication","summary":"MLL-rearranged leukemia depends on H3K79 methylation. Depletion of this transcriptionally-activating mark by DOT1L deletion or high concentrations of the inhibitor pinometostat downregulates HOXA9 and MEIS1, and consequently reduces leukemia survival. Yet some MLL-rearranged leukemias are inexplicably susceptible to low-dose pinometostat, far below concentrations that downregulate this canonical proliferation pathway.
